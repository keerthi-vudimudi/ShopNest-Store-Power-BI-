# ShopNest-Store-PowerBI-Dashboard
This is my first project in Power BI, and throughout the process of designing the Shopnest Store Sales Dashboard, I learned a great deal about data visualization, storytelling, and deriving actionable insights from complex data sets.

While working on this project, I gained hands-on experience in using Power BI to create interactive dashboards, design drill-through reports, and apply various data transformation techniques to ensure the data was clean and ready for analysis.

# Dashboard Features
Top Categories by Total Sales: Identified the best-selling product categories based on total sales figures.
Delayed Orders Analysis: Examined the number of delayed orders across categories, with a drill-through cross-report for deeper insights.
Monthly Comparison of Delayed vs. On-Time Orders: Tracked and compared delayed and on-time orders on a monthly basis.
Payment Method Analysis: Analyzed the most popular payment methods used by customers.
Product Rating Analysis: Highlighted the top-rated and lowest-rated products.
State-Wise Sales Analysis: Mapped high and low-performing sales regions, including drill-through cross-reports for further exploration.
Seasonal Sales Patterns: Explored and visualized seasonal trends in sales.
Revenue Analysis: Analyzed total revenue over time to identify key trends and patterns.

Overall, this project strengthened my proficiency in Power BI and reinforced my ability to translate raw data into meaningful business insights that can drive decision-making.
